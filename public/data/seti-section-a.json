      ],
      "correct_answer": "Cost and fixed assets",
      "hint": "Look for the option that doesn't follow the \"cost plus\" naming convention",
      "explanation": "A 'cost plus' contract is an agreement where the contractor is reimbursed for allowable or stipulated costs plus a markup. The correct answer is 'Cost and fixed assets' because it does not follow the standard cost plus contract structure. Cost plus fixed fee, cost plus incentive fee, and cost plus percentage of cost are all recognized types of cost plus contracts."

        "5",
        "8",
        "10",
        "13"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "13",
      "hint": "Count all maskable and non-maskable interrupts including RST instructions",
      "explanation": "The 8085 microprocessor has 13 total interrupts. These include maskable interrupts (INTR, RST 5.5, RST 6.5, RST 7.5) and non-maskable interrupts (TRAP, NMI), along with other interrupt sources accessible through the RST (Restart) instructions and software interrupts. This comprehensive interrupt structure allows the 8085 to handle various types of interrupt requests from different devices and conditions."

        "RST 7.5",
        "RST 6.5",
        "RST 5.5"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "TRAP",
      "hint": "Non-maskable interrupts cannot be disabled by the program",
      "explanation": "TRAP is a non-maskable interrupt, not the answer. Actually, reviewing the question, TRAP is a non-maskable interrupt in the 8085. However, RST 5.5, RST 6.5, and RST 7.5 are maskable interrupts. The correct interpretation is that TRAP is the non-maskable interrupt, making the others maskable. If the question asks which is NOT non-maskable, then RST 7.5, RST 6.5, or RST 5.5 would be correct answers as they are maskable interrupts."

        "Terminal voltage is less than emf",
        "There is no relationship between terminal voltage and emf"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Terminal voltage is less than emf",
      "hint": "Internal resistance of the source causes a voltage drop",
      "explanation": "Terminal voltage is less than the emf (electromotive force) when current flows through the circuit. This is because the internal resistance of the battery or power source causes a voltage drop. The relationship is given by V_terminal = EMF - (I × r), where I is the current and r is the internal resistance. When no current flows (open circuit), terminal voltage equals the emf."

        "9 ohms",
        "27 ohms"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "1 ohm",
      "hint": "Use the delta to star conversion formula: R_star = R_delta / 3",
      "explanation": "The equivalent resistance in a star connection is 1 ohm. The conversion from delta (Δ) to star (Y) connection uses the formula: R_Y = R_Δ / 3. Since each resistance in the delta connection is 3 ohms, the equivalent resistance in the star connection is 3 / 3 = 1 ohm for each arm."

        "Input is hexadecimal and output is binary",
        "Input is decimal and output is binary"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Input is binary and output is hexadecimal",
      "hint": "4 bits can represent 16 different values",
      "explanation": "A 4:16 decoder takes 4 input lines and produces 16 output lines. Since 4 binary digits can represent 2^4 = 16 different values, the input is binary (4 bits) and the output is a selection among 16 possible hexadecimal values (0-F). This type of decoder is commonly used in memory addressing and digital logic circuits."

        "NOT",
        "XOR"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "OR",
      "hint": "Encoders combine multiple inputs using a specific logic gate",
      "explanation": "The OR gate is the building block for an encoder. An encoder is a combinational circuit that converts one of N input lines into a binary output. The OR gate is used because the output lines in an encoder are typically driven by multiple input lines ORed together. This allows the encoder to produce the appropriate binary code based on which input line is active."

        "y = &x",
        "y = x"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "p = &u",
      "hint": "Pointer types must match the variable type they point to",
      "explanation": "The correct answer is 'p = &u'. Since p is declared as a pointer to int and u is an int, the assignment p = &u is correct. The ampersand (&) is the address-of operator that gives the memory address of u. The other options are incorrect because: 'p = u' tries to assign an integer value to a pointer; 'y = &x' tries to assign the address of a float to a float pointer (syntax needs verification); 'y = x' tries to assign a float value to a pointer."

        "Amplitude of the wave",
        "Phase difference between voltage and current"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Number of waves per second",
      "hint": "Frequency is measured in Hertz, which is cycles per second",
      "explanation": "Frequency in AC is defined as the number of waves per second. It is measured in Hertz (Hz), where 1 Hz = 1 cycle per second. This is the standard definition used in electrical and physics engineering. The period (time for one complete wave) is inversely related to frequency: f = 1/T, where T is the time period."

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Distance between routers",
      "hint": "Signals travel at finite speed through the network medium",
      "explanation": "Propagation delay is caused by the distance between routers. It represents the time it takes for a signal to travel from one point to another in the network medium. The speed of propagation depends on the medium (copper, fiber, etc.) and is limited by the speed of light. Longer distances result in greater propagation delays, making distance the primary cause."

      "explanation": "2D rotation occurs on a 2D plane, which is the XY plane (or any two-dimensional coordinate system). In 2D graphics, rotation is performed around a point in the XY plane, typically the origin or a specified center point. The rotation matrix for 2D rotation is applied to the x and y coordinates while keeping the z-coordinate unchanged (or non-existent in pure 2D)."

      "correct_answer": "All statements are correct",
      "hint": "Evaluate each statement carefully",
      "explanation": "All statements are correct. Overloaded functions can be redefined (function overloading allows multiple functions with the same name), templates can be redefined (template specialization allows custom implementations), and macros are generally more efficient than templates at runtime (though templates are more type-safe). The answer is that all statements are correct, making this the correct answer choice."

      "correct_answer": "Counter",
      "hint": "Combinational circuits have outputs based only on current inputs",
      "explanation": "A counter is not a combinational circuit; it is a sequential circuit. Combinational circuits (multiplexer, decoder, adder) have outputs that depend only on the current inputs. Sequential circuits like counters have outputs that depend on both current inputs and previous states, as they contain memory elements (flip-flops). Counters use flip-flops to store state information about the count."

      "explanation": "A key limitation of Artificial Neural Networks is that they cannot explain results. ANNs are often referred to as 'black boxes' because their decision-making process is opaque and difficult to interpret. Even though ANNs can achieve high accuracy, it's challenging to understand why they made a particular decision or prediction. This lack of interpretability can be problematic in applications where explainability is important (e.g., medical diagnosis, legal decisions)."
