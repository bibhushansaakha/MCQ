        "hint": "Ohm's law has specific conditions. Consider what happens with semiconductors and varying temperatures.",
        "explanation": "Ohm's law states V = I × R (voltage equals current times resistance). However, it only applies to ohmic materials where resistance remains constant with applied voltage and temperature. Limitations include: (1) Non-ohmic materials like semiconductors don't follow linear V-I relationship; (2) At very high voltages, even ohmic materials may deviate; (3) Temperature changes affect resistance; (4) High-frequency effects create skin effect in conductors; (5) Superconductors violate this law entirely. In semiconductors, the relationship is exponential due to thermal voltage effects. Understanding these limitations is crucial for circuit design, especially in non-linear circuit analysis.",

        "correct_answer": "Voltage is potential difference (energy per unit charge), current is flow of electrons (charge per unit time)",
        "hint": "Voltage is related to energy/potential, current is related to charge flow.",
        "explanation": "Voltage (V, measured in Volts) represents the potential difference or energy per unit charge between two points. It's the driving force that causes charge movement. Mathematically, V = W/Q where W is energy and Q is charge. Current (I, measured in Amperes) is the rate of charge flow, mathematically I = Q/t where Q is charge and t is time. Key differences: (1) Voltage can exist without current (open circuit); (2) Current requires a complete path; (3) Voltage is a potential, current is actual flow; (4) Voltage is measured between two points, current through a component; (5) In AC circuits, they can be out of phase. An analogy: voltage is like water pressure, current is like water flow rate. Both are essential for understanding circuit behavior.",

        "hint": "Think about the relationship between distance (energy) and speed (power).",
        "explanation": "Power (P, measured in Watts) is the rate at which energy is transferred, transformed, or consumed. Energy (E, measured in Joules) is the total amount of work done. Relationship: P = E/t or E = P×t. Electrical power is calculated as P = VI = I²R = V²/R. Key concepts: (1) Power is instantaneous, energy is cumulative; (2) A device rated 100W consuming power for 10 hours uses 1000Wh = 3.6MJ of energy; (3) Reactive power (VAR) doesn't consume energy but affects efficiency; (4) Real power (Watts) actually does useful work; (5) Power factor determines how much of apparent power becomes real power. In household electricity bills, you pay for energy (kWh), not instantaneous power. This distinction is crucial for understanding device efficiency and energy conservation.",

        "hint": "Consider the outermost electron shell and how easily electrons can move.",
        "explanation": "The fundamental difference between conductors and insulators lies in their atomic structure and electron behavior: Conductors (Cu, Al, etc.): (1) Have loosely bound valence electrons (typically 1-3 in outermost shell); (2) Electrons can move freely through the material, creating free electron sea; (3) Very low resistivity (10^-8 Ω·m); (4) High conductivity; (5) At room temperature, sufficient thermal energy makes electrons mobile. Insulators (rubber, glass, ceramic): (1) Have tightly bound valence electrons (typically 5-8 in outermost shell); (2) Require huge energy to free electrons; (3) Very high resistivity (10^15+ Ω·m); (4) Almost no conductivity; (5) Electrons remain bound to atoms. Semiconductors (Si, Ge): (1) Intermediate properties with 4 valence electrons; (2) Conductivity can be controlled by doping; (3) Temperature significantly affects conductivity. This atomic structure difference explains why copper is an excellent conductor while rubber is a good insulator.",

Voltage distribution: V₁ = IR₁ = 1A × 10Ω = 10V; V₂ = IR₂ = 1A × 20Ω = 20V. Total voltage: 10V + 20V = 30V ✓. Key series circuit properties: (1) Same current through all components; (2) Voltages add up to source voltage; (3) Total resistance equals sum of individual resistances; (4) If one component fails (open circuit), entire circuit stops; (5) Series resistors act as voltage dividers.

        "explanation": "For parallel resistors: 1/R_eq = 1/R₁ + 1/R₂ = 1/6 + 1/3 = 1/6 + 2/6 = 3/6 = 1/2. Therefore R_eq = 2Ω. Total current: I = V/R_eq = 12V/2Ω = 6A. Branch currents: I₁ = V/R₁ = 12V/6Ω = 2A; I₂ = V/R₂ = 12V/3Ω = 4A. Total: 2A + 4A = 6A ✓. Key parallel circuit properties: (1) Voltage across all branches is same; (2) Currents split among branches proportionally to conductance; (3) Equivalent resistance is always less than smallest resistor; (4) If one branch opens, others continue working; (5) Adding more parallel resistors decreases total resistance. Practical applications: household circuits use parallel for independent device operation.",

Delta (Δ) configuration: Three resistors form closed triangle. Conversion formulas: Y to Δ: R_A = (R₁R₂ + R₂R₃ + R₃R₁)/R₃; R_B = (R₁R₂ + R₂R₃ + R₃R₁)/R₁; R_C = (R₁R₂ + R₂R₃ + R₃R₁)/R₂. Δ to Y: R₁ = (R_A × R_B)/(R_A + R_B + R_C); R₂ = (R_B × R_C)/(R_A + R_B + R_C); R₃ = (R_C × R_A)/(R_A + R_B + R_C). Uses: (1) Three-phase power systems; (2) Bridge circuits analysis; (3) Network simplification when standard series-parallel reduction fails; (4) Complex resistance calculations. When a circuit has resistors in neither pure series nor pure parallel arrangement, Y-Δ conversion often allows simplification. This is essential for analyzing balanced three-phase circuits and complex networks.",

Mathematically: ΣI_in = ΣI_out or ΣI_total = 0 (considering current direction). Physical significance: Based on law of charge conservation - charge cannot accumulate at a node; any charge entering must leave. Derivation: Electric charge is conserved; no charge can be created or destroyed at a node; therefore, rate of charge entering must equal rate leaving. Applications: (1) Multi-branch circuit analysis; (2) Node voltage method for circuit analysis; (3) Determining unknown currents in networks; (4) Verifying circuit measurements. Example: If three branches meet at a node with I₁=2A entering, I₂=1A entering, then I₃=3A must leave. KCL is one of two Kirchhoff laws and is fundamental to nodal analysis, one of the most powerful circuit analysis techniques.",

        "hint": "Consider energy as you traverse a closed loop. What must be conserved?",
        "explanation": "Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL) states: The algebraic sum of all voltages (both rises and drops) around any closed loop is zero. Mathematically: ΣV = 0 (around a closed path). Derivation from Faraday's law: Faraday's law states ∮E·dl = -dΦ/dt (line integral of electric field around closed path = negative rate of magnetic flux change). In circuits without changing magnetic flux (quasi-static approximation), dΦ/dt ≈ 0, giving ∮E·dl = 0, which is KVL. Physical significance: Based on energy conservation - energy supplied by sources must equal energy consumed by resistances in any loop. As you traverse a loop, voltage rises (+) and drops (-) must algebraically sum to zero. Practical application: (1) Writing loop equations for circuit analysis; (2) Mesh current analysis; (3) Finding unknown voltages; (4) Verifying measurements around loops. Example: In a loop with 10V source, and resistors dropping 3V and 7V: +10 - 3 - 7 = 0 ✓. KVL is essential for circuit analysis and understanding power distribution.",

Properties: (1) Superposition applies - response to multiple inputs equals sum of individual responses; (2) Homogeneity - scaling input scales output equally; (3) Easier to analyze mathematically; (4) Examples: resistor circuits, linear op-amp circuits. Non-linear circuits: Components don't follow linear V-I relationships. Examples: (1) Diodes - exponential V-I: I = I_s(e^(V/V_T) - 1); (2) Transistors - complex relationships; (3) Inductors with saturation; (4) Circuits with switching. Analysis methods: Linear circuits use Kirchhoff's laws, superposition, Thévenin/Norton theorems. Non-linear circuits require: (1) Graphical methods; (2) Numerical solutions; (3) Load line analysis; (4) Piecewise linear approximations. Practical importance: Understanding circuit linearity determines applicable analysis techniques.

The network behavior is symmetric with respect to direction. Examples: (1) Pure resistor networks - reversing source direction reverses current direction proportionally; (2) Passive RLC circuits without diodes; (3) Linear circuits with only passive components. Key characteristic: Response is independent of which terminal is source and which is load. Unilateral circuits: Networks where current direction matters; swapping terminals gives different results. Examples: (1) Circuits containing diodes - conduct one way, block reverse; (2) Transistor circuits - inherently directional; (3) Vacuum tube circuits; (4) Circuits with rectifiers or any non-linear elements. Practical implications: (1) Bilateral circuits allow flexible power transfer; (2) Unilateral circuits provide rectification and power flow control; (3) Analysis methods differ: Bilateral uses superposition freely; Unilateral requires careful consideration of operating conditions. Understanding this distinction is crucial when designing circuits where current direction control is important, such as in power systems and signal processing.",

        "explanation": "Superposition Theorem: For linear networks with multiple independent sources, the response (voltage/current) at any element is the algebraic sum of responses caused by each independent source acting alone (others deactivated). Application procedure: (1) Deactivate all sources except one (voltage sources → short circuit; current sources → open circuit); (2) Calculate response due to remaining source; (3) Repeat for each source; (4) Algebraically sum all responses. Advantages: (1) Simplifies complex multi-source analysis; (2) Each calculation involves simpler circuit; (3) Useful for understanding source contribution; (4) Can solve using any method (nodal, loop, Thévenin). Limitations: (1) Only applies to linear circuits - output proportional to input; (2) Cannot be used for power calculations directly (P = VI is non-linear); (3) Doesn't apply to circuits with non-linear elements (diodes, transistors); (4) For dependent sources, must handle carefully - they remain active. Example: Circuit with 10V and 5V sources: V_total ≠ V_10V source - V_5V source; instead calculate each separately and add. Practical note: When calculating power using superposition, must first find currents/voltages, then compute power - you can't superpose power directly.

Method 2 - Finding V_Th and R_Th separately: V_Th = voltage across open-circuited terminals with load removed; R_Th = equivalent resistance seen from load terminals with all independent sources deactivated (voltage sources → short, current sources → open). Advantages: (1) Simplifies analysis when load changes; (2) Quick for finding maximum power transfer condition; (3) Useful for load analysis; (4) Can be found experimentally. Relationship to Norton: Norton equivalent has current source I_N = V_Th/R_Th with parallel resistance R_N = R_Th. Practical applications: (1) Battery equivalent circuit; (2) Finding power delivery to load; (3) Circuit simplification for specific analysis.

Maximum power: P_max = V_Th² / (4R_Th). Proof: Power to load P = V_Th² × R_L / (R_Th + R_L)². To find maximum, differentiate with respect to R_L and set to zero: dP/dR_L = V_Th² × [(R_Th + R_L)² - R_L × 2(R_Th + R_L)] / (R_Th + R_L)⁴ = 0. This gives (R_Th + R_L) = 2R_L, so R_Th = R_L. Efficiency consideration: When R_L = R_Th, power delivered to load equals power lost in source resistance (50% efficiency). In practice, matching source to load for maximum power vs maximum efficiency depends on application: (1) Maximum power - small signal circuits, antenna matching; (2) Maximum efficiency - power supplies (want R_L >> R_Th for efficiency near 100%).

        "explanation": "For sinusoidal v(t) = V_m sin(ωt): Peak (Maximum) Value: V_m - the maximum instantaneous voltage magnitude. RMS (Root Mean Square) Value: V_rms = V_m/√2 ≈ 0.707V_m. Calculation: V_rms = √(1/T ∫[0 to T] v²(t) dt). For sinusoid: V_rms = V_m/√2. Average Value: V_avg = 2V_m/π ≈ 0.637V_m (for half-period). For full period: V_avg = 0 (areas above and below cancel). Why RMS is important: (1) RMS value represents equivalent DC voltage that delivers same power to resistive load; (2) Power calculations use RMS: P = V_rms × I_rms × cos(φ); (3) Ratings on AC devices (like 230V supply) are RMS values; (4) Relates to heat dissipation: Heat ∝ I²R, and I_rms² is what matters. Practical example: 230V AC supply means 230V_rms (≈ 325V peak). A light bulb rated 100W at 230V actually operates at 100W with RMS current and voltage. Confusion prevention: When we say "wall outlet is 230V," we mean 230V_rms, not peak. Peak would be 230√2 ≈ 325V. Form Factor: (1) Form Factor = Peak/RMS = √2 for sinusoid; (2) Different for non-sinusoidal waveforms; (3) Used to characterize waveform shapes.

        "hint": "Consider how V_BE changes with temperature and how this affects bias point.",
        "explanation": "Class AB Biasing Requirements: Objective: Set small quiescent current in both transistors simultaneously to eliminate crossover distortion while keeping heat reasonable. Target quiescent current: typically 1-5% of maximum output current. Biasing Methods: Voltage Divider Method: (1) Two resistors divide V_CC to set base voltage; (2) Resistors chosen so both transistor bases see appropriate DC voltage; (3) One base at ~0.7V, other at ~-0.7V (for opposite polarity pair); (4) Results in small base current for both transistors; (5) Simpler but less stable. Current Source Biasing: (1) Uses precision current source to set quiescent current; (2) More stable and accurate; (3) Often uses diode string or current mirror; (4) Provides better temperature compensation; (5) More complex circuit. Diode Bias Circuit: (1) Two diodes in series with resistor set bias voltage; (2) Diode voltage divider: V_be_total = 0.6V + 0.6V = 1.2V (for two diodes); (3) Diodes conduct same current as transistor bases; (4) Natural temperature compensation through matching. Temperature Effects on V_BE: V_BE decreases with increasing temperature: (1) Temperature coefficient: approximately -2mV/°C; (2) At 0°C: V_BE ≈ 0.75V; (3) At 100°C: V_BE ≈ 0.55V; (4) Change ΔV_BE ≈ -200mV for 100°C change. Problem without compensation: (1) As temperature rises, V_BE decreases; (2) Same bias voltage results in higher base current; (3) Higher I_B means higher collector current; (4) Quiescent current increases uncontrollably; (5) Transistor can enter saturation; (6) Excessive heat generation; (7) Thermal runaway possible (heating increases I_C, which increases heat, increasing T, decreasing V_BE further). Temperature Compensation Techniques: Diode compensation: (1) Diode in bias network tracks V_BE change; (2) As transistor V_BE decreases with temperature, diode provides proportional decrease in bias voltage; (3) Quiescent current remains nearly constant; (4) Diodes thermally coupled (same substrate) to transistor. Resistive temperature sensing: (1) Use thermistor in bias network; (2) Negative temperature coefficient (NTC) thermistor increases resistance as temperature rises; (3) Reduces base current, offsetting temperature-induced V_BE change. Current source compensation: (1) Current source output also temperature-dependent; (2) Properly designed, changes in same direction as V_BE; (3) Compensation proportional to current changes. Active compensation: (1) Electronic circuit monitors temperature; (2) Adjusts bias voltage dynamically; (3) More complex but best compensation. Practical design example: Base bias voltage set to 1.2V (sum of two 0.6V transistors' V_BE at 25°C). Use two silicon diodes in series matching transistor type: (1) Diodes thermally bonded to output transistors; (2) As T increases, both V_BE and diode voltage drop together; (3) Relative change cancels out; (4) Quiescent current stays stable. Heatsinking consideration: (1) Place bias diodes physically near power transistors; (2) Use thermal coupling compound; (3) Heat conducted to bias diodes quickly; (4) Compensation response matches heat rise in transistors. Stability analysis: (1) Stability factor S = (R_B × S_ico) / (0.1 × I_C); (2) S > 10 desired for stability; (3) Proper bias network achieves this. Verification: (1) Measure quiescent collector current at different temperatures; (2) Should remain stable within ±10% from 0°C to 100°C; (3) Check for thermal runaway conditions. Circuit design practice: (1) Always include bias compensation in Class AB designs; (2) Use matched pairs of diodes and transistors; (3) Thermal design must account for bias stability; (4) Add current limiting resistors in bases for safety. Understanding Class AB biasing is critical for designing reliable power amplifiers and preventing thermal failure.",

        "hint": "One transistor supplies current to load, other provides return path to ground.",
        "explanation": "Push-Pull Amplifier Configuration: Basic structure: Two complementary transistors (NPN/PNP pair) alternately conduct into same load. Complementary pair: NPN transistor (npn) - conducts during positive half-cycle, pulls output toward V_CC (or positive rail). PNP transistor (pnp) - conducts during negative half-cycle, pulls output toward ground (or negative rail). Load connection: (1) Both collectors/drains connected together at output; (2) Load (speaker) connected between output point and V_CC/2 (for split supply); (3) Or transformer with center tap to split supply rails. Timing coordination: (1) When input goes positive: NPN conducts, PNP off; (2) When input goes negative: PNP conducts, NPN off; (3) Switching designed to avoid shoot-through (both conducting simultaneously). Advantages over single-ended: (1) Power output doubled - both transistors contribute (vs one in single-ended); (2) Even harmonics eliminated - symmetric operation produces only odd harmonics; (3) Transformer core uses both directions of B-H curve - reduces core size; (4) DC current in output transformer cancels - no core saturation; (5) More efficient use of supply current; (6) Better impedance matching to load; (7) Reduced 2nd, 4th, 6th... harmonics. Power relationships: Single-ended: P_out = V_cc × I_c / 2. Push-pull: P_out = 2 × (V_cc × I_c / 2) = V_cc × I_c. For same peak current: push-pull delivers twice the power. Transformer-coupled push-pull: Center-tapped transformer in output: (1) Primary center tap at V_cc/2 (split supply); (2) Top transistor pulls up, increasing primary current; (3) Bottom transistor pulls down, decreasing primary current; (4) Both contribute to flux in same direction; (5) Transformer reflection: secondary sees full voltage swing; (6) Step-down ratio for impedance matching. Output impedance: Lower than single-ended for same transistor size: (1) Both transistors contribute to driving current; (2) Effective output impedance = r_o/2 (in small signal); (3) Better load matching. Distortion characteristics: (1) Total harmonic distortion (THD) lower due to harmonic cancellation; (2) Crossover distortion specific issue for Class B push-pull; (3) Class AB push-pull minimal crossover distortion. Efficiency maximum: 78.5% (π/4) for Class B push-pull with peak sine output. Practical design considerations: (1) Transistor matching critical - pair must have similar characteristics; (2) Bias temperature compensation essential; (3) Shoot-through protection circuits may be needed; (4) Driver stage must provide sufficient current; (5) Feedback often used to reduce distortion. Totem-pole configuration: Variant without transformer: (1) Direct coupling to single supply; (2) One transistor connects to V_CC, other to ground; (3) Used in logic gates, audio IC amplifiers; (4) Eliminates output transformer. Disadvantages: (1) Requires transformer or complementary pair; (2) More complex than single-ended; (3) Requires careful design to prevent shoot-through; (4) Temperature compensation necessary; (5) Output impedance imbalance possible. Applications: (1) Audio power amplifiers - most common output stage; (2) RF power amplifiers; (3) Motor drivers; (4) DC-DC converter switching stages; (5) Digital output drivers (CMOS totem-pole). Modern IC amplifiers: Most use some form of push-pull configuration internally, often with multiple stages for better performance. Understanding push-pull configuration is essential for power amplifier design and audio applications.",

        "explanation": "Tuned Amplifiers (Narrowband Amplifiers): Definition: Amplifiers with frequency-selective load networks (LC circuits) providing high gain at specific resonant frequency while rejecting others. Basic circuit: (1) Input: coupled through blocking capacitor or transformer; (2) Transistor biased in active region; (3) Load: LC resonant tank circuit instead of fixed resistor; (4) Output: tapped from tank or coupled through transformer. Operation at resonance: At resonant frequency f₀ = 1/(2π√(LC)): (1) Inductive and capacitive reactances cancel; (2) Tank impedance is maximum (purely resistive = R_p); (3) Maximum voltage gain occurs; (4) Gain = g_m × R_p where R_p is tank resistance; (5) Phase shift 0°. Operation off resonance: (1) Tank impedance decreases (becomes reactive); (2) Gain drops significantly; (3) Phase shift develops; (4) Frequency away from f₀ progressively rejected. Bandwidth and Q factor: (1) Bandwidth BW = f₀ / Q; (2) High Q gives narrow bandwidth (selective); (3) Q = f₀ / BW = 2πf₀L / R = 1/(2πf₀RC); (4) Practical Q values: 10-100 for LC oscillators; (5) Coupling factor determines bandwidth. Types of tuned amplifiers: Single tuned: (1) Only output tank tuned; (2) Simpler, single resonance peak; (3) Moderate selectivity. Double tuned: (1) Both input and output tanks tuned; (2) Better selectivity; (3) Steeper roll-off outside passband; (4) More complex. Stagger tuning: (1) Cascade multiple stages with slightly offset frequencies; (2) Flatter passband than single frequency; (3) Wider bandwidth with steep edges. Bandwidth control: (1) Coupling between stages affects bandwidth; (2) Tight coupling - wider bandwidth, multiple peaks; (3) Loose coupling - narrower bandwidth, single peak. Gain at resonance: Voltage gain: A_v = -g_m × Z_L where Z_L is tank impedance at resonance. Z_L_max = L / (RC) (quality factor relation). Peak gain increases with Q. Frequency response curve: (1) Peak at f₀; (2) Gain drops symmetrically (in dB) on either side; (3) Cutoff points at -3dB (0.707 peak gain); (4) Steepness determined by Q; (5) Roll-off rate -20dB/decade per pole for single tuned. Practical considerations: (1) Component tolerances affect resonant frequency; (2) Temperature changes shift frequency; (3) Load resistance affects Q and bandwidth; (4) Input coupling affects input impedance; (5) Parasitic capacitances affect high-frequency response. Compensation techniques: (1) Variable capacitor (varicap) for frequency tuning; (2) Temperature-compensating capacitors; (3) Automatic frequency control (AFC) circuits. Applications: (1) RF amplifiers - select desired station frequency; (2) IF (Intermediate Frequency) amplifiers in radios - fixed frequency, high selectivity; (3) Filters with gain; (4) Oscillators (regenerative); (5) Wireless power transmission; (6) Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) receivers. Advantages: (1) High gain at resonant frequency; (2) Excellent noise figure (less noise from out-of-band signals); (3) Strong rejection of unwanted frequencies; (4) Smaller power consumption than broadband equivalents; (5) Improved signal-to-noise ratio. Disadvantages: (1) Fixed or narrowly adjustable frequency; (2) Complex design and tuning; (3) Component matching critical; (4) Temperature sensitivity; (5) Stability concerns at high frequencies. Modern applications: (1) Still used in RF/RF circuitry; (2) Superheterodyne receivers use tuned IF stages; (3) Wireless sensor networks often use tuned circuits; (4) Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) uses resonant circuits for signal detection.

        "explanation": "Operational Amplifier Fundamentals: Definition: An integrated circuit (IC) incorporating multiple transistors, resistors, capacitors designed as a high-gain differential voltage amplifier. Internal structure: (1) Differential input stage - compares inverting and non-inverting inputs; (2) Voltage gain stage - amplifies small differential voltage; (3) Output stage - provides current drive capability; (4) Typically includes frequency compensation. Symbol and Terminals: Two inputs: (1) Non-inverting input (+) - positive input; (2) Inverting input (-) - negative input. Two power supply terminals: V_CC+ and V_CC- (or V_DD and V_SS). One output: V_out. Input terminals have high impedance, output low impedance (when working properly). Ideal Op-Amp Characteristics: (1) Infinite open-loop gain (A_ol = ∞); (2) Infinite input impedance (Z_in = ∞); (3) Zero output impedance (Z_out = 0); (4) Infinite bandwidth (BW = ∞); (5) Zero bias current (I_b = 0); (6) Zero offset voltage (V_os = 0); (7) Infinite Common Mode Rejection Ratio (CMRR = ∞); (8) Perfect frequency response. Practical Op-Amp Characteristics (typical values): Open-loop gain: 100,000 to 1,000,000 (80-120 dB). Input impedance: 10^6 to 10^12 Ω (2 MΩ for 741, 10¹² for JFET input). Output impedance: 50-200 Ω. Bandwidth (gain-bandwidth product): 0.5-100 MHz depending on type. Input offset voltage: 1-10 mV (reduced to μV with compensation). Bias current: 20-500 nA (reduced to pA with JFET input). CMRR: 80-100 dB. Slew rate: 0.5-100 V/μs (speed of output voltage change). Fundamental limitations: (1) Finite gain - requires feedback for consistent behavior; (2) Frequency dependent - gain rolls off at high frequency; (3) Bandwidth limited - gain-bandwidth product constant; (4) Offset voltage - output non-zero with zero input; (5) Bias currents - input currents flow; (6) Slew rate limiting - output cannot change faster than slew rate; (7) Power supply dependent - cannot produce beyond supply rails; (8) Temperature dependent - all parameters change with temperature. Linear Region (open-loop): V_out = A_ol × (V_+ - V_-). When input difference exceeds ~V_sat/A_ol (≈ μV), output saturates at ±V_sat (typically ±12V to ±15V). Saturation: (1) Output limited by power supply; (2) Cannot amplify further; (3) Acts as comparator in saturation. Negative Feedback Application: (1) Feedback stabilizes gain; (2) Closed-loop gain = -R_f/R_in for inverting amplifier; (3) Independent of open-loop gain (as long as open-loop gain >> closed-loop); (4) Fundamental principle of op-amp circuit design. Virtual Short Concept: With negative feedback: V_+ ≈ V_- (virtual short); (1) No actual connection; (2) Feedback adjusts output until inputs are nearly equal; (3) Allows simple analysis - assume equal input voltages. Input impedance with feedback: (1) Input impedance increases with feedback; (2) Z_in(cl) = Z_in(ol) × (1 + loop gain); (3) Inverting amplifier: input impedance ≈ R_in (determined by resistor). Common Op-Amp ICs: (1) 741 - general purpose, low cost, moderate performance; (2) LM358 - two-channel version, single supply capable; (3) TL072 - low noise, audio quality; (4) OPA2134 - audio grade, excellent specs; (5) LT1057 - precision, low offset. Op-Amp Circuits: (1) Inverting amplifier - gain -R_f/R_in; (2) Non-inverting amplifier - gain 1 + R_f/R_in; (3) Comparator - no feedback, output saturates; (4) Integrator - capacitor feedback; (5) Differentiator - capacitor input; (6) Instrumentation amplifier - three op-amp circuit. Practical design considerations: (1) Always use feedback with op-amps for linear operation; (2) Stability analysis important - may oscillate without compensation; (3) Power supply bypassing critical; (4) Component tolerances affect accuracy; (5) Input impedance affects source; (6) Output impedance may affect load.
