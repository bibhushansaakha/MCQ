        "question": "What is the relationship between terminal voltage and emf?",
        "options": ["Terminal voltage is equal to emf", "Terminal voltage is greater than emf", "Terminal voltage is less than emf", "There is no relationship between terminal voltage and emf"],
        "correct_answer": "Terminal voltage is less than emf",
        "hint": "Consider the effect of internal resistance on the voltage supplied to external circuits.",
        "explanation": "Terminal voltage is always less than emf due to voltage drop across internal resistance: V = emf - I×r. The greater the current drawn, the larger the voltage drop across internal resistance, resulting in lower terminal voltage.",
