      "question": "What is latency in networks?",
      "options": ["Network bandwidth", "Time delay for data to travel from source to destination", "Data transmission speed", "Network congestion"],
      "correct_answer": "Time delay for data to travel from source to destination",
      "hint": "Measured in milliseconds",
      "explanation": "Latency is the time delay between sending data and receiving a response. It's influenced by distance, number of hops, and network congestion. Lower latency is desirable for real-time applications.",

      "correct_answer": "Data formatting, encryption, and compression",
      "hint": "Layer 6 translates data",
      "explanation": "The Presentation layer (Layer 6) translates, encrypts, and compresses data to ensure compatibility between different systems. It handles data formatting, encryption, decryption, and compression/decompression.",

      "hint": "Separates trusted and untrusted networks",
      "explanation": "A DMZ (De-Militarized Zone) is a buffer zone between an organization's internal network and the internet. It contains servers that need internet access but maintains security separation between internal and external networks.",

      "options": ["Synchronous uses clock signal, asynchronous relies on start/stop bits", "Asynchronous is always slower", "They are the same", "Synchronous is less reliable"],
      "correct_answer": "Synchronous uses clock signal, asynchronous relies on start/stop bits",
      "hint": "Timing synchronization differs",
      "explanation": "Synchronous transmission uses a shared clock signal to synchronize sender and receiver timing. Asynchronous transmission uses start and stop bits to frame each character. Synchronous is more efficient for high-speed transfers; asynchronous is simpler for slower connections.",
