      "explanation": "The correct symbol for first angle projection is ⊥. First angle projection is a method of orthographic projection where the object is placed in the first quadrant.

      "explanation": "There are 2 main categories of memory storage: volatile memory (RAM - loses data when powered off) and non-volatile memory (ROM, storage drives - retains data when powered off).
