      "question": "What is the formula for no-load voltage gain in a common emitter configuration?",
      "options": [
        "Av = βRC/re",
        "Av = -βRC/re",
        "Av = RC/re",
        "Av = -RC/re"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Av = -RC/re",
      "hint": "The negative sign indicates 180-degree phase shift",
      "explanation": "The formula for no-load voltage gain in a common emitter configuration is Av = -RC/re. The negative sign indicates that the output signal is 180 degrees out of phase with the input. Av is the voltage gain, RC is the collector resistance, and re is the emitter resistance. This formula is used when the base current effect is negligible."

      "question": "What are the types of perspective projection?",
      "options": [
        "One-point and two-point perspective",
        "Two-point and three-point perspective",
        "One-point, two-point, and three-point perspective",
        "Only one-point perspective"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "One-point, two-point, and three-point perspective",
      "hint": "Perspective projections are based on vanishing points",
      "explanation": "The types of perspective projection are: one-point perspective (one vanishing point), two-point perspective (two vanishing points), and three-point perspective (three vanishing points). These are the main types used in technical and artistic drawing. One-point perspective is used for frontal views, two-point for corner views, and three-point for aerial or worm's-eye views."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "In a semaphore problem, what does \"18P, xV, ...\" represent?",
      "options": [
        "18 signal operations and x wait operations",
        "18 wait operations and x signal operations",
        "18 processes and x variables",
        "18 producers and x consumers"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "18 wait operations and x signal operations",
      "hint": "P represents wait (Proberen/down), V represents signal (Verhogen/up)",
      "explanation": "In semaphore notation, 'P' represents the wait operation (decrement) and 'V' represents the signal operation (increment). Therefore, '18P, xV' means 18 wait operations and x signal operations. This notation comes from Dijkstra's semaphore definition where P stands for 'Proberen' (test) and V stands for 'Verhogen' (increment)."

      "question": "What is the latest amendment to the Labor Act?",

        "2073",
        "2074",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "2074",
      "hint": "Nepal uses a different calendar system",
      "explanation": "The latest amendment to the Labor Act is 2074 (in the Nepali calendar). Nepal uses the Nepali Bikram Sambat calendar where 2074 corresponds to 2017-2018 in the Gregorian calendar. This represents the most recent legal amendments to labor regulations in Nepal."

      "question": "How many parallel TCP connections does FTP typically use?",
      "options": [
        "1",
        "2",
        "3",
        "4"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "2",
      "hint": "One for control, one for data",
      "explanation": "FTP typically uses 2 parallel TCP connections: one for control commands and one for data transfer. The control connection (port 21) is used to send commands and receive responses, while the data connection (port 20 in active mode) is used to transfer the actual file data. This separation allows for more efficient management of commands and data."

      "question": "Which of the following is based on the principle of conservation of charge?",
      "options": [
        "KCL",
        "KVL",
        "Ohm's Law",
        "Coulomb's Law"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "KCL",
      "hint": "Kirchhoff's Current Law deals with charge conservation",
      "explanation": "KCL (Kirchhoff's Current Law) is based on the principle of conservation of charge. KCL states that the sum of currents entering a node equals the sum of currents leaving the node. This is a direct application of the principle that electric charge cannot be created or destroyed. KVL, on the other hand, is based on conservation of energy."

      "question": "What is the primary purpose of a Project Charter?",
      "options": [
        "To outline the project scope and objectives",
        "To define the project schedule",
        "To identify project risks",
        "To allocate project resources"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "To outline the project scope and objectives",
      "hint": "This is the foundational document that authorizes the project",
      "explanation": "The primary purpose of a Project Charter is to outline the project scope and objectives. A Project Charter is a formal document that authorizes the project, defines its high-level objectives, describes the project manager's authority, identifies key stakeholders, and establishes the business case for the project. It serves as the foundational document that gives the project manager authority to proceed."

      "question": "How many transistors are used in Class A amplifiers?",
      "options": [
        "1",
        "2",
        "3",
        "4"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "1",
      "hint": "Class A amplifiers are single-transistor configurations",
      "explanation": "Class A amplifiers typically use 1 transistor. In a basic Class A amplifier configuration, a single transistor is biased in the active region and conducts throughout the entire input cycle. This results in high linearity and low distortion but poor efficiency. More complex Class A amplifiers may use additional transistors for impedance matching or buffering, but the fundamental amplification is achieved with one transistor."

      "question": "What is the purpose of Gradient Descent?",
      "options": [
        "To maximize a function",
        "To minimize a function by iteratively moving in the direction of steepest descent",
        "To find the global maximum of a function",
        "To solve linear equations"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "To minimize a function by iteratively moving in the direction of steepest descent",
      "hint": "It's an optimization algorithm used in machine learning",
      "explanation": "The purpose of Gradient Descent is to minimize a function by iteratively moving in the direction of steepest descent (negative gradient). It is a first-order optimization algorithm commonly used in machine learning to minimize loss functions during model training. By following the negative gradient, the algorithm iteratively adjusts parameters to find local (and hopefully global) minima."

      "correct_answer": "Software engineering",
      "hint": "This model was one of the first structured software development approaches",
      "explanation": "The Waterfall model is the oldest approach for software engineering. Introduced in the 1970s, it was one of the first structured software development methodologies. The Waterfall model divides software development into sequential phases: requirements, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance, with each phase flowing into the next like a waterfall."
